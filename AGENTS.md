# Agent Instructions

## Architecture

The code is organized in three layers, lowest to highest:

1. **`src/commands/`** — thin wrappers around external CLI tools (`tmux`, `git`, `tmuxinator`) and a generic shell utility (`runCommand`, `runAttachedCommand`). Functions in this layer are tool-specific and keep the tool name in their identifier (e.g. `isTmuxInstalled`, `listTmuxSessions`, `switchTmuxSession`).
2. **`src/sessions/`** — orc-specific logic that composes the low-level commands into operations on the orc domain. Functions here drop the tool qualifier (e.g. `getCurrentSession`, `findMatchingSession`, `switchSession`).
3. **`src/cli/`** — high-level CLI commands defined with citty (`new`, `list`, `switch`, `detach`, `delete`). These wire arguments to the mid-layer functions.

Tests live alongside their source as `*.test.ts`. Shared test infrastructure (`setup.ts`, `factories/`, `helpers/`) lives in `test/`.

## On-Disk Paths

Orc follows the XDG Base Directory Specification for all on-disk data:

- **Config**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (fallback `~/.config`). Used to locate Tmuxinator project files.
- **Cache / state**: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` (fallback `~/.cache`). Used for worktrees and any orc-managed runtime state.

When reading or writing new on-disk paths, always go through `process.env.XDG_*` with the specified fallback rather than hardcoding `~/.cache` or `~/.config`. See `src/commands/tmuxinator.ts` for the pattern.

## CLI vs TUI

Orc has two interaction modes:

- **CLI**: every subcommand (`orc <subcommand>`) is non-interactive. All required arguments must be supplied; missing arguments produce an error rather than a prompt or interactive picker. This keeps subcommands predictable for agents and scripts.
- **TUI**: launched by running `orc` with no subcommand. All interactive flows (session selection, confirmations, browsing) live here.

Subcommands never fall back to interactive prompts. If a user needs interaction, they launch the TUI.

## Stale TUI Session

The TUI runs inside a hidden tmux session named `_tui` (the control session, see `src/sessions/control-session.ts`). That session launches orc once and keeps the same process alive, so it goes on running whatever binary it started with. When you change TUI code, a running `_tui` session is stale and will not reflect your edits until it is killed and recreated.

When modifying the TUI, kill the stale control session before re-running orc:

```bash
tmux kill-session -t _tui
```

## CLI Output

Use `process.stdout.write` for command output, not `console.log`. CLI output is program data that should pipe cleanly to other tools — `console.log` is for diagnostics and goes through Node's console formatting layer. Remember to include the trailing `\n` since `process.stdout.write` does not append one.

## Git Workflow

- REQUIRED: invoke the `git-atomic-commit` skill at the start of every session.
- Each commit captures one logical change. Before presenting work, evaluate whether the diff could be split into atomic commits and propose the split.
- Code under review must be unstaged. The unstaged diff should reflect exactly what will be committed — never present a staged diff for review.

## Naming

Avoid unnecessary abbreviations in code identifiers and prose. The test: would you say it aloud when talking to someone? You'd say `config`, `repo`, `id` — those are fine. You wouldn't say `dir`, `func`, or `args` — write `directory`, `function`, and `arguments`. Well-known acronyms like CLI, TUI, XDG, JSON, YAML stay as acronyms.

## File Names

All source and test files use kebab-case (e.g. `agent-status.tsx`, `use-interval.ts`, `session-list.test.tsx`). React component and hook exports keep their conventional casing (`AgentStatus`, `useInterval`); only the filename is kebab-case.

## Documentation

Document every function with a JSDoc comment, including a `@param` line for each parameter and a `@returns` line describing the return value. This applies to private helpers, not only exported functions; omit `@returns` only when the function returns nothing. React components are the exception — document their props on the props type and give the component itself a one-line summary.
