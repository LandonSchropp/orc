# Orc

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Orc is an _opinionated_ personal CLI orchestrator for running parallel Claude Code sessions. It's
built tightly around Git worktrees, tmux, and Tmuxinator.

## Why

Many of the existing tools build around orchestrating agents/worktrees are great, but they weren't
quite what I was looking for with _my_ workflow.

- **Existing TUI managers** ([Agent Deck](https://github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck),
  [Agent-of-Empires](https://github.com/njbrake/agent-of-empires), [Claude
  Squad](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad)) are great but use single-pane sessions. This leaves
  no room for a separate shell, editor, or dev server window.
- **Desktop GUI tools** ([Conductor](https://conductor.build) and similar) replace your editor and
  pull you out of the terminal. You lose terminal access, Git history, and any custom tmux setup.
- **CLI worktree utilities** ([Worktrunk](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk),
  [agent-worktree](https://github.com/nekocode/agent-worktree), and friends) handle worktrees and
  custom commands well, but don't provide a session switcher or per-session status view.
- **Composing tools** ([Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) +
  [Worktrunk](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk) + [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) or
  [sesh](https://github.com/joshmedeski/sesh)) gets you most of the way, but misses the unified
  per-session status view across all features.

## Installation

Orc is not published to a package registry. Install it from a clone of this repo:

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) (the runtime Orc executes against), plus [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator), and [Git](https://git-scm.com).
2. Clone this repo and install dependencies:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LandonSchropp/orc.git
   cd orc
   bun install
   ```

3. Symlink the `orc` entrypoint into a directory on your `PATH` (e.g. `~/.local/bin`):

   ```sh
   ln -sf "$PWD/src/index.ts" ~/.local/bin/orc
   ```

4. Verify the install:

   ```sh
   orc --help
   ```

5. Register the status hook with Claude Code. Orc detects per-agent status by reading state files
   that Claude Code writes via hooks. Without this step, status detection silently does nothing.
   Add the following to either `~/.claude/settings.json` (global) or `.claude/settings.local.json`
   in a specific project:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "orc hook status" }] }],
       "Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "orc hook status" }] }],
       "Notification": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "orc hook status" }] }]
     }
   }
   ```

   A future release may package this as a Claude Code plugin so the manual step goes away.

The symlink points at your local checkout, so edits to the source are picked up on the next invocation — no rebuild step.

## How It Works

Orc operates at two levels:

- **Project**: An Orc project groups related sessions. It comes from either a Tmuxinator project or
  a local Git repository discovered under your configured [project paths](#configuration). One
  project per repo.
- **Session**: A tmux session spawned from a Tmuxinator project, paired with a Git worktree. The
  session named `main` runs directly on the project's main worktree, on its current branch. Every
  other session runs in its own linked worktree, isolated in a separate working directory on a
  branch named after the session.

## Configuration

Orc reads optional settings from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/orc/settings.json` (defaulting to
`~/.config/orc/settings.json`).

- **`projectPaths`**: A list of globs pointing at local Git repositories to offer as projects
  alongside your Tmuxinator ones. Each match that contains a `.git` entry becomes a project named
  after its directory. A leading `~/` expands to your home directory.

  ```json
  {
    "projectPaths": ["~/Development/*"]
  }
  ```

  With the example above, every Git repository directly under `~/Development` appears in the TUI's
  project picker. These directory projects have no Tmuxinator config of their own, so they launch
  from your `default` Tmuxinator project with its root overridden. A repository that already has a
  Tmuxinator project at the same path is offered as that Tmuxinator project rather than duplicated,
  and paths that don't exist are ignored.

## Interfaces

Orc has two main interfaces:

- **CLI**: Run individual commands for one-off tasks and automation. Every subcommand is
  non-interactive, so Orc fits cleanly into shell aliases, scripts, and AI agents.
- **TUI**: Browse and juggle sessions interactively. Run `orc` with no subcommand to drop into a
  full-screen manager where you can switch between sessions, see their status, and create new ones
  without leaving the keyboard.

## Commands

- `orc new <project> <session>`: Spawn the project's Tmuxinator template as a new session and
  attach. Name the session `main` to run on the project's main worktree; any other name gets a
  dedicated linked worktree.
- `orc list`: Plain-text list of sessions for piping into other tools or for checking state without
  entering the TUI.
- `orc switch <project> <session>`: Switch to a session by name.
- `orc detach`: Detach from the current Orc session.
- `orc delete <project> <session>`: Permanently delete the tmux session and worktree.

## TUI

Run `orc` (no args) to open a full-screen session manager, modeled on [Subtask's
UI](https://github.com/zippoxer/subtask). It's where you live when juggling several features in
flight at once.

- **Unified view across projects**: All Orc sessions in one scrollable list, grouped by Tmuxinator
  project, with session counts in the header.
- **Per-session status**: Each row surfaces whether the session is Working, Waiting, or Idle,
  alongside its Git branch and time since last pane output.
- **Inline lifecycle**: Create, attach, and delete sessions with single-key shortcuts. No need to
  drop back to the CLI.
