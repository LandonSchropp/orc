# Contributing

Orc is an opinionated personal tool, built around one particular workflow. Issues and
pull requests are welcome, but the roadmap stays the maintainer's — please open an issue
to discuss a change before investing in a large pull request.

## Setup

Orc runs directly from source. Follow the [Installation](README.md#installation) steps
in the README to clone the repo, install dependencies, and symlink the entrypoint.

## Before opening a pull request

Run the checks and make sure they pass:

```sh
bun test
bun run lint
bun run check-types
```

## Architecture and conventions

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the layered architecture, the CLI/TUI split, naming and
file-name conventions, and the documentation style expected for new code.

## Commits

Keep commits atomic — each commit should capture a single, self-contained logical change.
